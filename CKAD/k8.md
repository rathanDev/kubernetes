Pods -> Replicasets -> Deployment -> Service 

ReplicaSets
Ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time, 
helping to manage traffic by scaling the application. 
ReplicaSets are generally used when control over the pods is required

Deployments
Manage the lifecycle of pods at a higher level, 
providing additional features like rolling updates, rollbacks, and version control. 
Deployments also manage ReplicaSets, 
which are lower-level abstractions that provide basic scaling mechanisms.

Services
Act as a gateway for communication and load balancing 
by defining a logical set of pods that provide the same functionality
